# B-B_website
Rytterskolens B&amp;B website

It's the website of Rytterskolen Bed and Kitchen
I started creating the website but some of the rooms where still being constructed so the project is still not completed.
Also some text, which should be translated and added is missing.

I started this project in summer 2018 after I finished Responsive Web Design course (In the first semester of software engineering Beng), then I learnt more advanced ways to add more functionalities to the website so I decided to start from scratch.
